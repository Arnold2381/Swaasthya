# Swaasthya
Your Health Companion  
Swaasthya is a self-assessment app.  
This app can predict the possible diseases the user has if given at least 4 symptoms.  
It also shows the information about the disease and the preventive measures that could help cure the disease.  
It also shows the nearby hospitals such as eye hospital, dentist etc. by knowing the user's location.  
We have also created a chatbot alongside this application to provide helpful information regarding COVID-19.
