# Swaasthya
### Your Health Companion  
  
In recent times due to COVID-19 most of the people die due unavailability of proper diagnosis and medical services. During these COVID times, going to the hospital for minor diseases can be pretty dangerous so we are making this self-assessment app which could diagnose the user with the disease by knowing the symptoms. This could be very helpful in those remote regions where proper medical services are not available in hand or the patient is in need of immediate medical attention.  
  
Swaasthya is a self-assessment and emergency response app. This app can predict the possible diseases the user has if given the right symptoms. It also shows the information about the disease and the preventive measures that could help cure the disease. We were also planning to show the nearby hospitals such as eye hospital, dentist etc. by knowing the user's location.
  
We have added fitness features for the user to monitor and maintain their health. A medical record is also being maintained for the user to keep their health records at hand and accurate in case of further treatments or diagnosis. We have also created a chatbot alongside this application to provide helpful information regarding COVID-19. This will also help spread awareness among the general population.
